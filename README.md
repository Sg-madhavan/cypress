## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the test cases locally. 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sg-madhavan/cypress.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cypress
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the Cypress test cases, use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner where you can see and run all the available test cases. 

Alternatively, to run the tests headlessly (without the Test Runner UI), use:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

### Writing New Tests

Test cases are located in the `cypress/integration` directory. To create a new test, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file with a `.spec.js` extension in the `cypress/integration` directory.

2. Write your test case using Cypress commands. Here's a simple example:

   ```javascript
   describe('My First Test', () => {
     it('Visits the Cypress website', () => {
       cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io')
       cy.contains('About').click()
       cy.url().should('include', '/about')
     })
   })
   ```

3. Save your file, and your test will automatically be picked up by the Cypress Test Runner.
